    title: 'Does a baby\'s name affect its chances in life?',
    content: '<p class="story-body__introduction"> When parents spend hours poring over baby name books they may imagine that their choice will have a major impact on their child\'s life. But do names make a difference? Two recent books put this idea under the microscope.</p><p>Choosing a name for a child is complicated. Not only should it sound right with the family name but future nicknames - good and bad - need to be taken into consideration. A name might honour a favourite grandparent, but it will also have a forgotten meaning to be unearthed in books, and dubious modern associations to be checked on Google.</p><p>Dalton Conley and his wife, Natalie Jeremijenko, were halfway through this pleasant but painstaking process when their baby girl was born, two months premature.</p><p>"We had narrowed down the selections to a bunch of E- names, but we couldn\'t ultimately decide," says Conley, who lives in New York. "Then we came up with the idea of, \'Let\'s just constrain the first degree of freedom. Let\'s just give her the first letter and then she can decide when she\'s old enough what it stands for.\'" </p><p>And so, E was born. Now 16, she hasn\'t yet felt the need to extend her first name. "I think once you\'re given a name, you get used to it - it\'s part of you," she says. E\'s little brother, meanwhile, Yo Xing Heyno Augustus Eisner Alexander Weiser Knuckles, did take up his parents\' offer to change his name. He added the Heyno and Knuckles when he was four, and his parents made the changes official. </p><p>"I have been called a child abuser online," says Dalton Conley, the author of Parentology: Everything You Wanted to Know about the Science of Raising Children but Were Too Exhausted to Ask. "I don\'t think I\'ve saddled them with some horrible burden. They like the fact that they have unique names now."</p><p>Over the last 70 years, researchers have tried to gauge the effect on an individual of having an unusual name. It is thought that our identity is partly shaped by the way we are treated by other people - a concept psychologists call the "looking-glass self" - and our name has the potential to colour our interactions with society. Early studies found that men with uncommon first names were more likely to drop out of school and be lonely later in life. One study found that psychiatric patients with more unusual names tended to be more disturbed. </p><p>Over the last 70 years, researchers have tried to gauge the effect on an individual of having an unusual name.

Early studies found that men with uncommon first names were more likely to drop out of school and be lonely later in life. One study found that psychiatric patients with more unusual names tended to be more disturbed. </p><p>A similar conclusion is reached by Gregory Clark, the economist behind the book The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility. Although the main focus of his research is family names, Clark has looked at first names too - specifically, the names of 14,449 freshmen students attending the elite University of Oxford between 2008-2013. By contrasting the incidence of first names in the Oxford sample with their incidence among the general population (of the same age), he calculated the probability, relative to average, that a person given a particular name would go to Oxford. (For the purposes of his research he excluded students with non-English or Welsh surnames.)</p><p>He notes that there are more than three times as many Eleanors at Oxford than we might expect, given the frequency of that first name among girls in the general population, and Peters, Simons and Annas are not far behind.  Conversely, there is less than a 30th of the expected number of Jades and an even smaller proportion of Paiges and Shannons. An Eleanor is 100 times more likely to go to Oxford than a Jade.</p><p>However, there is no evidence that it\'s the names causing such a marked discrepancy, rather than other factors they represent, Clark says. Different names are popular among different social classes, and these groups have different opportunities and goals. </p><p>"That\'s something that\'s emerged in modern England that didn\'t exist around 1800," he says. When he re-ran his study, but this time looking at students attending Oxford and Cambridge in the early 19th Century, he found the correlation between names and university attendance far less marked. First names simply weren\'t the social signifiers they are now.</p><p>What\'s happened since then is a move towards unusual, even unique, names. Before 1800, Clark says, four first names referred to half of all English men. In 2012, according to the Office for National Statistics, the top four names (Harry, Oliver, Jack, Charlie) accounted for just 7% of English baby boys (and the picture was much the same in Wales).</p><p>Similarly in the US, in 1950, 5% of US parents chose a name for their child that wasn\'t in the top 1,000 names. In 2012, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wait-but-why/how-to-name-a-baby_b_4551427.html" class="story-body__link-external">that figure was up to 27%</a>. </p><p>As late as the 18th Century, it wasn\'t uncommon for parents to call multiple children the same name - two Johns for different grandfathers, for example. Now parents increasingly look for unique names or spellings of names. As Jean Twenge points out in her book the Narcissism Epidemic, Jasmine now rubs shoulders in naming lists with Jazmine, Jazmyne, Jazzmin, Jazzmine, Jasmina, Jazmyn, Jasmin, and Jasmyn. </p><p>As baby names become a matter of choice rather than tradition, they reveal more about the people doing the choosing. An example of this is the growing ease with which one can guess whether a person in the US is black or white.  Roland Fryer and Steven Levitt point out that in California in the years running up to 2003, around 40% of black girls were given names that weren\'t bestowed on a single white girl in the state.</p><p>The implications of this clearer signalling of class and race are striking. In <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w9873" class="story-body__link-external">a study from 2003</a>, called Are Emily And Greg More Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal? Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan sent nearly 5,000 CVs in response to job advertisements in Chicago and Boston newspapers. The CVs were the same, but half were given fake names that sounded like they belonged to white people, like Emily Walsh or Greg Baker, and the other half were given names that sounded African American, like Lakisha Washington or Jamal Jones.  The call-back rate from employers was 50% higher on the "white" names then the "black" names. The effects were noted even for federal contractors with "affirmative action" policies, and companies boasting they were "equal opportunities" employers. </p><p>The researchers inferred that employers were using first names to discriminate unfairly against black candidates, perhaps at an unconscious level. Those same prejudices might also come into play at the interviewing stage, but a black applicant called Greg Baker, who receives an invitation to an interview, has at least got his foot in the door.</p><p>There is also striking evidence of names triggering different outcomes for schoolchildren.</p><p>David Figlio, now at Northwestern University, <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w11195" class="story-body__link-external">analysed the scores of some 55,000 children in a school district of Florida</a>. Instead of just distinguishing between "white" and "black" names, he codified what aspects of names meant that they were more likely to belong to black children and children from low-income families. This allowed him to create a sliding scale, which went, for example, from Drew to Dwayne to Damarcus to Da\'Quan. Figlio found that the further along this scale he went, the worse the school test scores and the less likely the student was to be recommended for the schools\' programme for "gifted" students. Strikingly, this held true for brothers within a family, and even - although the sample size was small - for twins. Figlio believes that the fault lies with the expectations of schoolteachers and administrators - at schools with more black teachers, the effects were less marked. </p><p><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w11277" class="story-body__link-external">In separate research</a>, Figlio used the Florida school data to show that black boys who are given names more common among girls are more likely to develop behavioural problems when they reach puberty. The problems increase significantly when there are girls in the same year group with the same name.</p><p>If names do affect their bearers\' chance of success, it may not always be because of the reactions they cause in other people (the "looking-glass self"). Psychologists talk about "implicit egotism", the positive feelings we each have about ourselves. Brett Pelham cites the concept in explaining his finding that individuals called Virginia, Mildred, Jack and Philip proliferate in Virginia, Milwaukee, Jacksonville and Philadelphia - he believes they are drawn to live there. Another intriguing 2007 paper, entitled Moniker Maladies, found that people\'s fondness for the initials of their names could get in the way of success. Leif Nelson and Joseph Simmons analysed almost a century of baseball strikeouts and found that hitters with the initial K had a higher strike-out rate ("K" denotes a strike-out in baseball). They also found that graduate students with the initials C and D had a slightly lower grade point average than A and B students, and A and B applicants to law school were more likely to go to better colleges.</p><p>E Conley certainly has a fondness for her own initial - which in her case is her name. </p><p>"It\'s just cool that people, especially my friends, will never look at the letter E in the same way again," she says. But she doesn\'t seem to think her unusual name has had a profound influence on her life so far. "It\'s just an interesting experience - I\'m really no different than an Elizabeth."</p><p>Her father reflects that although his children haven\'t been teased - as some bearers of unusual names are - part of the reason might be the open-minded character of their school and neighbourhood. "I wouldn\'t say that names don\'t matter at all," he says. "But how they matter depends on the context."</p>',

I\'m looking at you Robert Downey Jr. Avri is a beautiful baby name, but certainly different. And you Alyssa Milano. Elizabella\'s beyond lovely, but again, not overly common.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="3" data-skip="true">Of course, there\'s nothing wrong with <a href="http://www.parenting.com/baby-names/top-names/unique-celebrity-baby-names-2014">unique names</a>. After all, I know enough Emmas and Aidans to fill a hospital nursery. But you may want to think twice before you pick a hard-to-pronounce, or "kinda out there" moniker for your little one. That\'s because a name that is perceived as too different may actually have an adverse effect on your child later in life.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="4">A 2012 <a href="http://college.usatoday.com/2014/10/06/could-your-name-be-impacting-your-success/" target="_blank">study</a> looked at how one\'s name impacts people\'s opinion of him or her. Names in different regions of the world were studied, and researchers found the more unusual the name, the more likely that person will be regarded as risky or dangerous.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="5">Researchers also found that simple statements were more believable if they were made by a person with a simple name, versus a person with an unusual name.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="6">As crazy as these findings sound, lead researcher Eryn Newman of the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand explains why these different sounding name biases exist.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="7">"From other research, we know that people think that food additives with easier names are safer than those with difficult names. So we don\'t think it is a stereotype about foreign names. Instead, we think that the easy names just feel more familiar or easy to process than the difficult names. To the Fred Flintstone parts of our brains, that feeling of ease or familiarity signals something that we can trust, but information that\'s difficult to process signals danger," she says.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="8" data-skip="true">Of course, how your child will be perceived is just one factor to consider in choosing <a href="http://www.parenting.com/article/finding-the-perfect-name">the perfect baby name</a>. If you truly love a particular moniker, who cares what a study has to say about it?</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="9">But consider that this finding supports multiple other studies that indicate a name has an impact on how people fare in their careers. For instance, Johns may have an easier time getting ahead than Reigns (ahem, Kourtney Kardashian). And throughout life, a person with a hard-to-pronounce name <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/06/30/psychology-explains-why-people-are-so-easily-duped/" target="_blank">may not be as believable</a>; say in a courtroom, or when confronted by a law enforcement official.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="10">So you may want to think long and hard about those unusual baby names on your list. Or don\'t, and just hope your baby becomes friends with, and ends up working for, others with unusual monikers.</p>',

In fact, this research even suggests that we may not have much real control over our own life decisions at all.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14px;" id="ext-gen92">According to studies compiled for the latest edition of&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQaD-JQkJWw&amp;feature=youtu.be">PBS Digital Studios\' BrainCraft series</a>, the act of writing our names over and over again throughout our lives can result in something called implicit egotism&nbsp;– a kind of obsession with the letters and sounds involved in our own names .&nbsp;</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14px;">\'The more we are merely exposed to something, like those letters, the more we like them,\' explains BrainCraft host Vanessa Hill in the video.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14px;">This means that we may be more attracted to places, careers and even people that have a link to&nbsp;the letters used in our names.<a style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079039">The study</a> BrainCraft cites in its video - authored by researchers Polman, Pollmann and Poehlman, of course - calls this idea the name-letter effect.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14px;">In the study, researchers found that working in a group of people who share your initials actually raises the quality of your group work - no matter what Keeping Up With the Kardashians might suggest.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The name-letter effect can also influence how people name their businesses, and even their babies.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14px;">For example, St Louis was found to have an unusually high amount of people named Louis, Philadelphia had more Philips and Virginia Beach had more Virginias.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Part of this is due to the attraction people may have to place names similar to their own names, but researchers also argue that the high number of people with name-locale connections&nbsp;could be related to people in the areas giving their children names close to home because they \'may simply be more accessible\'.</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14px;">This idea also applies to parents giving their children names which echo their own.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p><p class="mol-para-with-font"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The concept certainly makes sense in the case of some celebrities and their children, such as Will and Jada Pinkett Smith and their children Jaden, Willow and Willard (now known as Trey).

    title: 'How to pick a name for your baby',
    content: '<p>Picking a name for your child can sometimes feel overwhelming. In addition to the possibilities you think up, it\'s likely that friends and relatives will offer suggestions of their own – whether you want them to or not.</p><p>There\'s no right or wrong way to pick a name for your baby. The most important consideration is to choose one you love.</p><p>Ultimately, your child will grow into whatever name you pick. Below are a few things to keep in mind as you decide.</p><h2>Sound</h2><p>Think about how the name will sound when you call your child: Is it nice to hear, or does it sound harsh? Does it go well with your last name?</p><p>Some parents think longer first names work better with shorter last names, while others think the opposite. And some people think combining a first name that ends in a vowel with a last name that <em>starts</em> with a vowel isn\'t usually a great idea because the names can run together.</p><p>You also might want to avoid choosing a first name that rhymes with a last name. And for your child\'s sake, skip puns: A name like "Holly Wood" or "Bud Weiser" might not seem so funny after a while – especially when your child is a teenager.</p><h2>Uniqueness</h2><p>Many parents want to find a <a href="/0_unique-baby-names_10398843.bc">unique name</a> that will distinguish their child. But sometimes an extremely unusual name can bring your child unwanted attention instead. Think about possible mispronunciations to make sure your child won\'t be subjected to a lifetime of correcting how others say it.</p><h2>Significance</h2><p>It\'s easy to research name meanings online to help you choose the perfect one for your baby, especially if you\'re having trouble finding one that feels right. For example, "Ingrid" might be a family name, but knowing that it means "hero\'s daughter" could also be the perfect way to honor family members who served in the military.</p><h2>Initials</h2><p>Naming a boy Zachary&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Thomas may lead to an unfortunate nickname in school. And in case your child someday wants to put her monogram (in which the last initial is in the center, flanked by her first and middle initials) on her luggage, you\'ll want to avoid naming her Beatrix Dixon Adams. That would be BAD. Oops!</p><h2>Names that age well</h2><p>When you pick a name, imagine your child in a professional situation, at a job interview, or giving a presentation to a client. A name that suits an adorable baby or small child – like Binky, Bunny, or Lucky – might seem cloying when your child is an adult.</p><h2>Look for win-wins</h2><p>What can you do if you want your child\'s name to reflect her heritage, but family members are pressuring you to give her your beloved grandmother\'s name – which is not on your top 10 list? Give your child the name you want as a first name and your grandmother\'s name as a middle name. (Or do the opposite and call your child by her middle name.) You could also give her your grandmother\'s name but use a nickname.</p>',

    title: '7 WAYS TO MAKE SURE YOUR BABY HAS THE MOST “UNIQUE” NAME ON THE BLOCK',
    content: '<p>Maybe it’s because we are the generation of Jennifers, Megans, and Brittanys, but it seems like everyone wants their child to have a unique name nowadays.</p><p>Gone are the days of picking a name from the<a href="https://www.babble.com/parenting/most-popular-baby-names-of-2015-revealed/"> “Top 20&nbsp;Baby Names of the Year”</a> lists.

Here are seven ways to create a “unique” name.</p><h2>1.&nbsp;Use a character name from your favorite book/movie/television show.</h2><p>This can be a bit risky if you want a truly unique name – it’s highly unlikely that you are the only person who enjoys your favorite television show. If you go this route, it’s best to use the character’s middle name or surname, or even to choose a really obscure character in the show. Everybody and their mother is going to have a kid named Daenerys or Tyrion in the next couple of years, so it’s better to opt for Targaryen or even Quaithe.</p><p>These types of names are doubly satisfying because not only will you have a unique name, but you can choose potential friends based on recognition ability!</p><h2>2. Name your child after a little-known color or a noun.</h2><p>I’m not talking about naming your bundle of joy Apple or something ridiculous&nbsp;like that — it’s way overused by now anyway. I’m talking about a really unique color or noun. You could be the first mother on the block with a Thistle (a color AND a noun!), a Cyan, or a Slate.</p><p>If you’re really into European names (and who isn’t now?) take a trip to your nearest IKEA and find your next child’s name among the Fyrkantigs, the Dagstorps, and the Norroras! You’ll know you have a really unique name if nobody else can pronounce it.</p><h2>3. Gender-bend a name.</h2><p>This has been done before; <a href="https://www.babble.com/entertainment/ryan-reynolds-and-blake-lively-choose-gender-neutral-name-for-daughter/" target="_blank">Ryan Reynolds named his little girl James</a> (and his wife’s name is Blake), Phoebe from <em>Friends</em>&nbsp;ended up naming one of her girls Chandler, and I went to high school with a female Michael. Need I go on? We all know using a male name on a female is edgy. But what if we switched it?</p><p>A boy named Sue. Or maybe something like Tabitha; you could call him Tabs. It sounds radical, but isn’t that what unique names are all about? Bend the rules!</p><h2>4. Add extra letters or punctuation into the name.</h2><p>Being a Megan has taught me the truth — people love to add unnecessary letters to names. I can’t count the times I’ve had my name spelled Meghean, Meagen, or Maghen. It’s so unique!</p><p>Right now the trend is to add “y” or “x” where other letters would be perfectly fine (Jaxyn instead of Jackson), so if you truly want to be unique, you have to come up with some different letters.</p><p>How many names do you see with the letter “Q”? Qellie. Qarter. Qonnly. Just leave out the “u” — we all know it’s superfluous anyway. What about throwing some silent “h”s around? Hrichard. Hennlhey. Ladies, the possibilities are endless!</p><p>And if new letters aren’t your thing, we all know that apostrophes and hyphens are vastly underutilized when it comes to names. How about Ni’Qwel? Ren-Nay? Sh’on-ly?</p><h2>5. Look up some Greek and Latin roots to create a meaningful name.</h2><p>You want beauty, you go to the most romantic of all languages — Latin.</p><p><em>Murial</em> – like a mouse.</p><p><em>Lucidia</em> – shining.</p><p><em>Latidia</em> – wide.</p><p><em>Sibyneous</em> – like a spear.</p><p><em>Diago</em> – transmission.</p><p>All so lovely. All so full of history.</p><h2>6. Create your own never-before-seen name.</h2><p>It’s hard to realize how difficult this is until you’re sitting in your hospital bed post-birth with your pen poised over the birth certificate form, trying to come up with something amazing and different that your child will be proud to carry the rest of their life.</p><p>The simplest way to go about it is to combine two common (ugh) names that sound nice. Abilyn. Craigothy. Rebbenity. Tyoshua.</p><p>Mix and match, people. Mix and match.</p><h2>7. Let your cat walk across your keyboard, or, if you don’t have a cat, let a toddler type on your keyboard.</h2><p>My cat will provide an example: ,.l, oppppp’;njmazopl:UJIZUJSSS.&nbsp;Now how many kids do you know with that name? Zero? That’s what I thought.</p><p>Still not convinced? I’ll let my son Stormageddon show you how it’s done: ,., mnl,’?cv b</p><p>You’ll notice they both used punctuation I never even considered! From the mouths of babes. Or the fingers. Of babes. And dumb animals.</p><p>Now go out there and find your own unique name! You can do it!</p>',
