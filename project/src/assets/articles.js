It’s a boy’s name, can you guess what it is?</p><p><span id="more-499593"></span></p><p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1347446454451_373">The <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/">Social Security Administration</a> shows that virtually none of the top 20 most popular names from 1911 is still making the 2011 charts.</p><blockquote><p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1347446454451_376" data-meaningful="true" ct-id="5">For example, the most popular names in 2011 were “Jacob” for boys and “Sophia” for girls. But in 1911, they were “John” and “Mary.” Again, as mentioned above, neither “John” nor “Mary” even appears in the top 20 for 2011:</p></blockquote><p style="text-align: left" data-meaningful="true" ct-id="6">But there is one name, one name to rule them all. Quite literally, if you recognize the little guy in the photo up there. Did you guess? That’s Prince William. His name is the one name that has staunchly stood the test of time. One hundred years ago William was at slot 2 on the popularity charts. This year it’s number 3 and has made the top ten every year in between.</p><p style="text-align: left" data-meaningful="true" ct-id="7">The only girl name that has stayed on the popularity lists is “Elizabeth”. Interesting. For all the names, many of them bizarre, that have come and gone over the years the top 10 of 2011 is still pretty mellow.</p><p style="text-align: left" data-meaningful="true" ct-id="8">What do you think?

    title: 'Why Picking Unusual Baby Names May Harm Your Children',
    content: '<p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="2">Unusual baby <a href="http://www.parenting.com/baby-names/top-names/new-trend-celebrity-baby-names-its-all-about-letter-r">names are trendier</a> than ever. I\'m looking at you Robert Downey Jr. Avri is a beautiful baby name, but certainly different. And you Alyssa Milano. Elizabella\'s beyond lovely, but again, not overly common.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="3" data-skip="true">Of course, there\'s nothing wrong with <a href="http://www.parenting.com/baby-names/top-names/unique-celebrity-baby-names-2014">unique names</a>. After all, I know enough Emmas and Aidans to fill a hospital nursery. But you may want to think twice before you pick a hard-to-pronounce, or "kinda out there" moniker for your little one. That\'s because a name that is perceived as too different may actually have an adverse effect on your child later in life.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="4">A 2012 <a href="http://college.usatoday.com/2014/10/06/could-your-name-be-impacting-your-success/" target="_blank">study</a> looked at how one\'s name impacts people\'s opinion of him or her. Names in different regions of the world were studied, and researchers found the more unusual the name, the more likely that person will be regarded as risky or dangerous.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="5">Researchers also found that simple statements were more believable if they were made by a person with a simple name, versus a person with an unusual name.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="6">As crazy as these findings sound, lead researcher Eryn Newman of the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand explains why these different sounding name biases exist.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="7">"From other research, we know that people think that food additives with easier names are safer than those with difficult names. So we don\'t think it is a stereotype about foreign names. Instead, we think that the easy names just feel more familiar or easy to process than the difficult names. To the Fred Flintstone parts of our brains, that feeling of ease or familiarity signals something that we can trust, but information that\'s difficult to process signals danger," she says.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="8" data-skip="true">Of course, how your child will be perceived is just one factor to consider in choosing <a href="http://www.parenting.com/article/finding-the-perfect-name">the perfect baby name</a>. If you truly love a particular moniker, who cares what a study has to say about it?</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="9">But consider that this finding supports multiple other studies that indicate a name has an impact on how people fare in their careers. For instance, Johns may have an easier time getting ahead than Reigns (ahem, Kourtney Kardashian). And throughout life, a person with a hard-to-pronounce name <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/06/30/psychology-explains-why-people-are-so-easily-duped/" target="_blank">may not be as believable</a>; say in a courtroom, or when confronted by a law enforcement official.</p><p data-meaningful="true" ct-id="10">So you may want to think long and hard about those unusual baby names on your list. Or don\'t, and just hope your baby becomes friends with, and ends up working for, others with unusual monikers.</p>',

    content: '<p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text" data-meaningful="true" ct-id="1">As baby names get more and more creative, some parents are throwing their hands up and paying a professional to take over the extremely personal decision of naming their child.</p><p class="p1 body-el-text standard-body-el-text" data-meaningful="true" ct-id="2" data-skip="true">Services are popping up in the U.S. and Europe, <a class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-19/you-can-now-pay-someone-to-name-your-baby" target="_blank">according to </a><em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor"><a class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-19/you-can-now-pay-someone-to-name-your-baby">Bloomberg</a></em>, which help parents pick a name for their newborns. One firm in Switzerland charges a whopping $29,000, devoting two to three weeks and around 100 hours to the decision.&nbsp;</p><p class="p1 body-el-text standard-body-el-text" data-meaningful="true" ct-id="3">And what do you get for all of that money? Apparently, they check to make sure the name hasn\'t been trademarked or has "an aggravating past," which means that it doesn\'t sound like a name tied to wars or conflict, for example.</p><p class="p3 body-el-text standard-body-el-text" data-meaningful="true" ct-id="4">Sherri Suzanne, who runs New York\'s My Name for Life, works with culture experts to make sure a name fits with your family background.&nbsp;</p><p class="p3 body-el-text standard-body-el-text" data-meaningful="true" ct-id="5">"While some criteria, like name popularity, can be measured and ranked objectively, I find that other qualities, like morality of a name or likelihood for success, are very subjective and vary from person to person, community to community and particularly generation to generation," she told <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Bloomberg</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class="p3 body-el-text standard-body-el-text" data-meaningful="true" ct-id="6" data-skip="true">Or, call me crazy, but&nbsp;you could just &nbsp;browse some baby name lists like <a class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link" href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/parenting/g3415/flower-baby-names/" target="_blank">this one</a> or <a class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link" href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/parenting/a36277/popular-baby-names-meaning/" target="_blank">this one</a>, pick a name, put the extra thousands of dollars into your kid\'s college savings account, and call it a day. Just don\'t choose&nbsp;a name that sounds <a class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link" href="http://www.womansday.com/relationships/family-friends/a54576/baby-name-declared-illegal/" target="_blank">anything like poison</a>.&nbsp;</p>',
